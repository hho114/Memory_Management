//Introduction/Purpose
The purpose of this project is to have you write a simulation that explores the effects of 
limited memory and memory management policies. Your simulator will read policy information 
and the characteristics of the workload from input files and then will simulate the execution 
of the processes as well as decisions of Memory Manager (MM).

//Project Overview
The simulator will generate an output file with the trace of important events, as well as 
the memory map and the input queue status after each event. At the end of the simulation, 
your program will also print the average turnaround time per process.

//Design Constraints
No skeleton code was provided so we created all the code from scratch. We use three header 
files and one source file. Another constraint was implementing the code into the said diagrams, 
making sure all key components were correct and operating on our machines (Linux) and our 
other machine (Unix).

//Instructions to Compile
In the Linux Environment, create a folder titled "Project2" in the desktop.
Add files 'in1.txt', 'frame.h', 'functions.h', 'process.h', 'main.cpp' to Folder "Project2".
Open up the terminal in that folder, run the commands "g++ -o main main.cpp <Enter>"
Then run the command "./main <Enter>".
** Now we are in the programs Execution **
First, it'll ask "Memory Size: ", and you'll input "2000 <Enter>"
Then, it'll ask "Page Size: ", and you'll input "1 <Enter>" OR "2 <Enter>" OR "3 <Enter>"
Lastly, it'll ask "Enter name input file: ", and you'll input "in1.txt <Enter>"
